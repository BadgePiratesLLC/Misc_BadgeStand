Build Instructions:
<pic of Built Stand>

Your badge stand shipped with 2 stand bases, one is a blank PCB and the other is populated with Electronics that drop 5v from a micro USB down to 3.3v at the 2 pin locations. Of course one is 3.3v and the other is GND (see Pic below).

Additionally you have 4 stand offs of 2 different sizes, 2 screws and 2 nuts. Use these to connect your 2 Base pieces to each other, using the sizes to adjust the space between the bases.
